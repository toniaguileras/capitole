## Challenge
The business has requested the development of a scalable solution for managing the
companyâ€™s product catalog. The goal is to break down the existing monolithic application
into a microservices architecture. Our team is currently responsible for the Products API,
which will be a critical component of this new system. The requirements are described
below.

### Mandatory requirements
- Create a REST API application dedicated to serve the products catalog. A small copy of
the products to be served is provided below.
- Develop an endpoint to serve the products list.
- When serving the products list, take into account that we need to display a discount for
certain categories and special products:
- Electronics: 15%.
- Home & Kitchen: 25%
- SKUs ending in `5` like `SKU0005` will have an special 30% of discount.
- Only one discount can be applied at the same time; giving priority to the bigger
- The products can be filtered by `category`.
- The products can be sorted by `SKU`, `Price`, `Description` and `Category`
- The application should contain a `test` phase where basic features are tested.
- Brief explanation of architectural decisions.
- Use any good practice you think works the best here; since this will be treated as a
production feature.

### Nice to have
- API Documentation.
- Pagination.
- Integration tests.
